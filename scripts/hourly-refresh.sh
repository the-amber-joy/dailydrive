# Daily Drive — Hourly Podcast Refresh
# =============================================================================
# Runs every hour (e.g., :05 past each hour via cron).
# - Fetches only fresh podcast episodes (keeps music unchanged)
# - Reuses the music tracks saved by the daily full refresh
# - Skips entirely if no podcast episodes have changed since last run
#
# This keeps short-lived podcasts (like NPR News Now hourly bulletins)
# always available in your playlist without reshuffling your music.
#
# Cron example:  5 * * * * /opt/dailydrive/scripts/hourly-refresh.sh
# =============================================================================
